# Startup-valuation

###Project goals
Several valuation methodologies (at least 10) exist for start-ups. Usual factors on these methods are: team, financial forecast or business model, unique value proposition (PVP) and competitor comparison, between others. Selecting the appropriate valuation method and correctly analyzing the underlying factors for an upcoming business is a difficult endeavor for any first-time entrepreneur. Valuation is not only a key metric for investment but also expected ROI.
However, reaching a valuation is a complex and uncertain process, which relies heavily on experience, behavioral knowledge and intuition; even more so for making a decision to invest or push forward. The complexity and subjectivity are exacerbated when talking about pre-revenue valuations, that is start-ups which still have not produced any substantial sales or commitments from investors.
Therefore, instead of using a value metric, we use success probability, as this is a less subjective metric that can be optimized by following the patterns laid out by other successful endeavors and industry standards.

Keeping this in mind, this project objectives are:
1. Building a validated knowledge base to estimate tech start-ups success probability. This includes valuation methods, influencing factors and evidence/observations that lead to infer a probability of success.
2.  Use an expert system to infer success probability and personalized feedback using the knowledge base and appropriate inference motor.

###Target group
The end-user profile is: novice entrepreneur or person interested in starting up, with a clear idea and some thought about the market, unique value proposition and skills required. End users will be interested in improving and sanity-checking their proposition. This entrepreneur needs a tool to evaluate their proposition and obtain feedback on areas of improvement before seeking investment or deciding to follow through with their endeavor.

Start-up propositions to be evaluated should consist of pre-revenue, pre-money, high tech & deep tech businesses. Furthermore, start-ups should be active in the technology industry (IT, health, engineering, greenâ€¦) and preferably university spin-offs.
